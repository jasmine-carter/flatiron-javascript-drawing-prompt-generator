Drawing Prompt Generator is an app to help stumped artists find their inspiration again with randomly generated, or user generated drawing prompts, using a random library of words provided in the db:seed data in conjunction with the Faker gem.

##Installation
Clone the repo and run the following:

bundle install
rake db:seed

Start a rails server and navigate then via terminal open index.html
##Usage
Click "Get Prompted" to generate a random drawing prompt. Or if you're feeling like contributing, "Create Prompt" will show users a form to submit a new prompt that other users can see.

If you've created a masterpiece for your prompt, share it with "Submit Your Image"
If you'd like to see what other users created, select "See What Others Have Created"
